SCREEN SHARING
***************

**VNC ON** => Enables VNC screensharing

**TCPSyphon** => Enables TCPSyphon display

VNC SCREENSHARING
*****************

**Mac OSX:**

1.  Download Vine Server from http://www.testplant.com/dlds/vine/ and install it.
2.  Start Vine Server, in the menu select Server / Reverse Connection.

3.  Fill in the IP which is displayed on the screen of the PocketVJ.

4.  Voilà, you should have your computer display mirrored.


.. note::
    Your computer display must have the same resolution as the screen connected to the PocketVJ.
    If the display is confusingly stretched, it might be that your computers resolution is set too high.
    
    Set your computers resolution to max. 1920x1080 pixel and try it again.

    If you use a Retina Macbook, install RetinaDisplay Menu from www.phoenix-dev.com to change your resolution to low DPI.

**Windows:**

1. Download TightVNC for Windows from http://www.tightvnc.com/ and install it. Make sure you select complete installation!

2. You should find the TightVNC symbol in the taskbar, right-click it and select “Attach Listening viewer” and type in the address which is showing on the screen, without :5500.

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**

1. Install vnc4server: sudo apt-get install vnc4server
2. Open a terminal and type:

``vnc4server -connect 2.0.0.100:5500``

``x11vnc -connect 2.0.0.100:5500``

3. If you have a second monitor attached where the mapping is visible,
and you want to display this part of screen, use the -clip option:

``x11vnc -connect 2.0.0.100:5500 -clip 1920x1080+1920+0``


TCPSYPHON
**********

See tutorial: https://www.pocketvj.com/pocketvj-rtc

Very useful if you want to use PocketVJ as a second screen for VJ applications supporting Syphon or Spout.

1.  OSX: Download TCPSyphon Server http://techlife.sg/TCPSyphon/
    Win: Download TCPSpout Server http://techlife.sg/TCPSpout/ 
    and install it on your Computer.
    Mirrors: https://pocketvj.com/downloads/syphon.zip
    https://pocketvj.com/downloads/TCPSpout.zip

2.  Connect your computer to the same network as the PocketVJ.
    (make sure you are not connected to another network as well!).

3. Start TCPSyphon server, select the input under Syphon Server List.

4. Boot PocketVJ into TCPSClient mode and if your networksettings are right, your PocketVJ should automatically act as a Syphon display.

.. note::
    TCPSyphon Server should be running before you boot up the PocketVJ.
    Only use it if you have a RJ45 connection to the PocketVJ, we tested with Wifi and it is laggy.

    Max. numbers of TCPSyphon clients are 10.
    Your video application must support a Syphon output.

    Alternatively you can use Screen Capture Syphon http://techlife.sg/ScreenCaptureSyphon/ to define an area to be mirrored to the PocketVJ.

    For Linux: use Screensharing (VNC) with the -clip option which works pretty well.
    Instead of a second screen, attach a HD gameplay recorder to the HDMI port.
